# TASK RESULT

## I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- HTML
- CSS

- JAVASCRIPT

- GULP

- NPM

1.  I choosed Javascript , because it's a programming language that I know(good level),also I was thinking to use vue.js , but I have not good experience in using Vue.

2.  I use npm to download modules that I need.

3.  I create build via gulp few month ago, so I decide create
    mem-generetor with it. It gives a lot of opportunities such as:

- css to scss
- minify js,css

- build for production or build zip-file
